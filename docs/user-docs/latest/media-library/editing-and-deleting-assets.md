# Managing individual assets

The Media Library allows to manage individual assets, which includes modifying the asset's file details and location, downloading and copying the link to the asset file, and deleting the asset. Image files can also be cropped. To manage an asset, click on its ![Edit icon](../assets/icons/edit.svg) **Edit** button.

## Editing assets

Clicking on the ![Edit icon](../assets/icons/edit.svg) **Edit** button of an asset opens up a "Details" window, with all the available options.

- On the left, above the preview of the asset, control buttons (1) allow to perform various actions:
  <!-- TODO: fix icons -->
  - click on the Delete button ![Delete icon](../assets/icons/delete.svg) to delete the asset,
  - click on the Download button ![Download icon](../assets/icons/down2.svg) to download the asset,
  - click on the Copy link button ![Copy link icon](../assets/icons/down.svg) to copy the asset's link to the clipboard,
  - optionally, click on the Crop button ![Copy link icon](../assets/icons/down.svg) to enter cropping mode for the image (see [cropping images](#cropping-images)).
- On the right, meta data for the asset is displayed at the top of the window (2) and the fields below can be used to update the _File name_, _Alternative text_, _Caption_ and _Asset location_ (see [organizing assets with folders](/user-docs/latest/media-library/organizing-assets-with-folders.md)) for the asset (3).
- At the bottom, the **Replace Media** button (4) can be used to replace the asset file but keep the existing content of the other editable fields, and the **Finish** button is used to confirm any updates to the fields.
